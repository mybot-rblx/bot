## Steps to usage

1) Using our [Discord Bot Basics - How to create a bot application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9KQxREfn4c) video you'll be able to create a bot application which will then allow you to find the token for the bot.
2) Once you have obtained said token you can then put it within the value of the token key that you'll locate in the config.json.
3) Set a prefix and add yourself as an owner whilst in the config.json file.
4) Open up a terminal within the folder and run 'npm i' or 'npm install' which will then install the necessary packages that are located within the package.json file.
5) Once this process has completed you will now be able to run 'node .', please note that you will obviously need Node.js installed.
